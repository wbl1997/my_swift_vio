The ORBvoc.yaml is manually downloaded from [dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/s/lyo0qgbdxn6eg6o/ORBvoc.zip?dl=1)
which is not accessible without tunneling.
It is created by the authors of ORBSLAM2, has the same size as
the yml vocabulary used in an earlier commit of [ORB-SLAM](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM).
though their md5sum are different.

The latest version of ORB-SLAM and ORB-SLAM2 both used the same ORBvoc.txt which is smaller than the ORBvoc.yml.
Actually these files has exactly the same content.
