I made the following changes to okvis_ros to make it work on my laptop, Ubuntu 14.04.02.
1, removed dependency of PCL, which was used in okvis_ros for point cloud visualization. Commented relevent pcl headers, and pcl related members in Publisher.cpp and Publisher.hpp of okvis_ros/include/okvis
2, replaced FindEigen.cmake in okvis/cmake and okvis_ros/cmake folder with FindEigen3.cmake which is copied from my computer folder /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules. Then in every CMakeLists.txt in okvis, changed 
find_package( Eige REQUIRED )
include_directories(${EIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR}) 
into
find_package( Eigen3 REQUIRED )
include_directories(${EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR})
3, rewrote the package.xml into the standard catkin package.xml using build_depend and run_depend directives. Added tf to Catkin Depends in CMakeLists.txt of okvis_ros
4, changed okvis_ros/config/rviz.rviz to show landmarks and their observations instead of point clouds
